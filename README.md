# python-api-challenge
# The homework tested our ability to perform API calls to weather service and to google places & maps
# Over 900 random latitude and longitude coordinates were generated to which nearest cities were then determined
# City weather and coordinates were extracted from responses
# The city data set was then filtered to find ideal weather conditions
# Google maps and places were then used to plot cities and hotel information using gmaps
